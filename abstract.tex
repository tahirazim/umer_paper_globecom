Consumer data, such as documents and photos, are increasingly being
stored in the cloud. To ensure confidentiality, the data is encrypted
before being outsourced. 
However, this makes it difficult to search the encrypted data directly. 
Recent approaches to enable searching of this encrypted data
have relied on trapdoors, locally stored indexes, and homomorphic encryption.
However, data communication cost for these techniques is very high and 
they limit search capabilities either to a small set of 
pre-defined trapdoors or only allow exact keyword matching.

This paper addresses the problem of high communication cost of 
bloom-filter based privacy-preserving
search to measure similarity between the
search query and the encrypted data. We propose a novel compression 
algorithm which avoids the need to send the entire encrypted bloom filter 
index back to 
the client. This reduces the cost of communicating results to the client by 
over 95\%. Using sliding window bloom filters and homomorphic encryption
also enables our system to search over encrypted data using keywords that 
only partially match the originally stored words.
We demonstrate the viability of our system by implementing it on
Google Cloud, and our results show that the cost of partially matching
search queries on encrypted data scales linearly with the total number of 
keywords stored on the server.
