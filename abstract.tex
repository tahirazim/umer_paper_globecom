Consumer data, such as documents, photos and videos, are increasingly being
stored in the cloud. To ensure confidentiality of the data, it is outsourced
after encryption. However, this makes it difficult to search the encrypted data directly. Recent approaches to enable searching of this encrypted data
have relied on trapdoors, locally stored indexes, and homomorphic encryption.
However, data communication cost for these techniques are very high and they limit search capabilities either to a small set of 
pre-defined trapdoors or only allow exact keyword matching.

This paper addresses the problem of high communication cost of privacy-aware search which make use of bloom filters to measure the similarity score between search query and encrypted data. We have proposed a novel compression algorithm by 
avoiding the need to send back the entire encrypted bloom filter index to the 
client. This reduces the cost of communicating results to the client by over 95\%. Our scheme enables users to search using keywords that only partially match the originally stored words.
We implement partial matching using sliding window bloom filters and secure
search over arbitrary keywords using homomorphic encryption.
To demonstrate viability of our scheme we implement it on a real cloud, Google
ecosystem, and our results show that search queries with 2 to 10 keywords only
cost \$0.000002 to \$0.00002 per 1000 similar requests.
