\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}

While homomorphic encryption allows us to implement this system effectively, 
it is still much slower than symmetric and public-key encryption.
In this paper, we have demonstrated and tested our system with a comparatively 
small dataset. With larger amounts of data, the indexer will likely take 
much more time to generate the
encrypted index. To optimize indexing time we can
utilize scalable systems like Hadoop~\cite{hadoop} for indexing
purposes. In addition, it would be useful to explore CryptDB and MONOMI as
ways to improve the performance of both the indexer and the searcher.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented a privacy-aware similarity-based searching scheme
with reduced communication cost over encrypted data residing in an untrusted
cloud domain. Using a novel compression 
algorithm, our system avoids the need to send the bloom filter based index back to the 
user, reducing communication costs by over 95\%.
By using homomorphic encryption for index files, a cloud service provider can not 
learn the contents of 
the data files, the index files or the search queries. Furthermore, it cannot 
discern patterns from incoming queries. Moreover, unlike most existing techniques, our
proposed system supports similarity-based searching in addition to exact matching.
Finally, by not relying on trapdoors, it allows end users to formulate
arbitrary queries to search encrypted data.
